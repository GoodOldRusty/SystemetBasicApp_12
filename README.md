# SystemetBasicApp_12

This is a master branch of the app called SystemetBasicApp created by Rikard Fr√∂berg and Henrik Sandklef. It's an empty application with a database containing the API of Systembolaget. It's mainly beer and such. 
The purpose of our clone in this particular branch is to make changes to it and develop an alternative version of this basic app, make it a bit more modern and add different features using the database and the structure.

Project is run by a scrumban methodology, where we do pair programming, code review and sptint review using more continuous delivery to a develop branch, and finally to the master branch. 

This project is a part of TIG059 at University of Gothenburg, System science studies 2019.

SUMMARY
Workshop: 30 april 2019 
Attending: Mika W, Evelina B, Sebastian S, Sonja T, Jan S

The idea is to break down a framework for our project and list different features. After a couple of hours of discussions, we narrowed it down to the following: 

1. Build an app that starts with a checkbox or a button that controls whether the user is 20 years or younger 
2. It will then ask you what kind of party you're attending 
3. It will ask you how much money you have and sort products by volume and APK (alkohol per krona) 

It will be more modern and minimalistic than the basic version. Simple buttons, scandinavian air, using colors as guidence more than instructions and text blocks. 

During the workshop we prioritized different ideas for other features and decided to put them in the backlog for future developement. 

Our intention is to satisfy a student around 21 years old at Chalmers.
