# SystemetBasicApp_12

This is a master branch of the app called SystemetBasicApp created by Rikard Fr√∂berg and Henrik Sandklef. It's an empty application with a database containing the API of Systembolaget. It's mainly beer and such. 
The purpose of our clone in this particular branch is to make changes to it and develop an alternative version of this basic app, make it a bit more modern and add different features using the database and the structure.

Project is run by a scrumban methodology, where we do pair programming, code review and sptint review using more continuous delivery to a develop branch, and finally to the master branch. 

This project is a part of TIG059 at University of Gothenburg, System science studies 2019.
